            <div class="project-info-text">The idea behind this website started with me wanting to showcase my projects and have the ability to document my progress and experiences. As I developed the idea, it turned into a personal portfolio website where I could also showcase my skills and experience. The design and look of the website was the most important part. I wanted to create a website which was eye-catching, modern, and sleek.
                <br><br>I wanted to bolster my design and UX skills, so I used a more formal design process than I normally would for personal projects. There ended up being four iterations of my design process. The <a class="project-link" href="Media/design1.JPG" target="_blank">first iteration</a> was drawn up on a piece of scrap paper during a workshop when the project first came to me. The <a class="project-link" href="Media/design2.JPG" target="_blank">second</a> and <a class="project-link" href="Media/design3.JPG" target="_blank">third</a> were more formal sketches. The <a class="project-link" href="Media/design4.png" target="_blank">final</a> was a prototype made in Figma along with a <a class="project-link" href="Media/plan.JPG" target="_blank">3-step action plan</a>. I found this formal planning process to be very useful and helped me achieve my goal in a more focussed and efficient manner. I am very happy with how it has turned out.

            <div class="project-info-text">I was given the opportunity to develop and maintain a website for the MASTERSTROKE trial at Auckland Hospital. This was an exciting experience which allowed me to refine my website development and support skills. The design is simple and straight forward to keep the content at the forefront and to allow it to be read easily. This was my first time implementing a login page properly using encryption. There are a few different ongoing plans for the website in the pipeline. You can visit the website <a class="project-link" href="http://www.masterstroke.org.nz" target="_blank">here</a>. </div>

            <div class="project-info-text">During the 2021 Delta outbreak lockdown I got bored and starting coming up with fun ideas with different APIs. I came across the twitter API and thought I could create a bot which tweets something once a day. My girlfriend came up with the idea of a bot which compliments her every day. I thought it would be funny to have a template compliment where one word of the words is random each day. I found a random word generator API and linked that into the Twitter API, then scheduled a script to run once a day to post the tweet.

            <div class="project-info-text">During my final semester at University I took CompSci 399 where we had to collaborate as a group to create a project. My group decided to develop a video game and post it online for others to play. The game was called "Into the Dark" and was developed in Unity. My main role was the art lead. I created most of the artwork and assets for the game and controlled a lot of the art direction. This was my first experience working on a long term project as a group, and my first experience with Unity. The game took us a full semester to develop. With more time we could've made a longer game, but I am extremely proud of how this turned out. It was the crowning achievement of my degree and had an awesome experience creating it.
